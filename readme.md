## How to Deploy Our Project

1. Get yourself a Pi Zero, 4 pin LED, 220 ohm resistor and enough wire to make all of the connections
1. Place connectors to pins as instructed by image (Coming soon!)
1. Setup VNC or connect to your Pi Zero (Running Raspiben) in anyway you desire and have access to the terminal
1. In terminal, pip install bottle
1. Clone repo onto your desktop
1. Edit server HOST ip address at the bottom of the server.py to match ip given to pi
1. In terminal, $python server.py
1. connect to your pi's address with a web browser and click on individual lights to ensure everything is working!
